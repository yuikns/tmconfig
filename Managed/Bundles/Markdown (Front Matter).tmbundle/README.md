# Markdown-Front-Matter.tmbundle

Adds support for YAML front matter in Markdown files to TextMate.

## Features

- Highlights front matter as YAML.
- Strips front matter from document before running the markdown processor.

Note that this is only an extension to existing Markdown bundles, not a bundle handling Markdown itself. It is currently known to be working with:

 * [markdown.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/markdown.tmbundle) (the official Markdown bundle for TextMate)
 * [GitHub-Markdown.tmbundle](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitHub-Markdown.tmbundle)

## Installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
git clone https://github.com/noniq/Markdown-Front-Matter.tmbundle
```
