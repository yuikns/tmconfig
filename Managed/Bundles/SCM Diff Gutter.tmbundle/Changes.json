This leads to following error:\n\n    Update Gutter:38:in `block in &lt;main&gt;&#39;: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 (ArgumentError)\n    \tfrom Update Gutter:35:in `open&#39;\n    \tfrom Update Gutter:35:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;\n\nThis is especially annoying because this error pops up every time the document is saved (because the “Update Gutter” command runs on every save).\n\nSetting `ascii-8bit` encoding directly on the io object works around the issue as we only care about the beginning part of the line not the actual contents. Fixes #7."},{"commit":"ca69ff6ab9c939d14930a2a8aa7624c77e301527","date":"2016-09-14T08:34:43+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Refresh gutter on SCM changes","body":"Requires TextMate 2.0-beta.12.12"},{"commit":"fff73b99a0b18d02f26993d0f705bbe9a096297f","date":"2016-08-10T12:46:49-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Disable external diff programs","body":"This would open the external program on save, setting the `no-ext-diff` disables this feature."},{"commit":"834509ff3dc76ceb24d7ddc69d5026dcf125b7bb","date":"2016-06-10T22:04:25+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Ignore /usr/bin/git if /usr/bin/xcode-select -p fails","body":"On recent OS versions the /usr/bin/git executable will prompt the user to install git (if Xcode is not already installed) which can cause some user confusion, so we now avoid using /usr/bin/git unless Xcode is installed."},{"commit":"da4f506d5e85ab048d68b0239a73797921244684","date":"2016-05-30T22:28:17+02:00","author":"Florian Pircher","summary":"Use circle as image for changed state","body":"Previously it was difficult to tell the added and the changed image apart, especially when scrolling through source code."},{"commit":"438ffabc84a70a5e244c98d8883223e9307c0a1c","date":"2016-05-30T14:32:10+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Rename images to have “Template” suffix","body":"This is required starting with TextMate 2.0-beta.9.3."},{"commit":"7205662d53180a4fc8e47024a4b4c7f0b73a2ddd","date":"2016-05-30T12:21:27+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Setup SCM marks when opening a document","body":"Previously we would only update marks when saving a document.\n\nCurrently TextMate will also call our command when creating a new untitled document (in a project which use SCM) so we have to exit early if there is no file name.\n\nRequires TextMate 2.0-beta.9.3"}],"name":"SCM Diff Gutter"}
