However, this scope includes `source.ruby` only for within `create_table …` blocks, so everything outside these blocks did not get any syntax highlighting. (Nowadays it’s quite likely that schema.rb contains additional content like `add_foreign_key` statements and such.)"},{"commit":"cd9138c87cca189100b0d6c2cfe1f72fb912239c","date":"2015-11-17T13:01:26+00:00","author":"Mike McQuaid","summary":"Export RUBYLIB variable","body":"This is needed for it to be passed into subprocesses.
